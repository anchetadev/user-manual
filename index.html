                    Directly. Tell me what you need from me first, reasoning later. If you need help making a decision, same thing - tell me the outcome/action first and then explain the reasoning behind it. I can process a lot of different perspectives and I will play devil’s advocate, but only to the benefit of the outcome. I never take a different perspective to judge or belittle another person’s position. Sometimes I can get annoyed if I feel like someone is making me think for them, but with action leading the conversation, I understand that you’ve given lots of thought to whatever you’re asking me which makes me feel like you value my time.

Some may also find that I care too much about responsibility, however, I understand that my fellow workers are human too and we have so much more to us than our lives at work. Know that my core motivation is that I believe the faster we can make something and make it well, the faster we can go home (and the better we can make a piece of the world)!
